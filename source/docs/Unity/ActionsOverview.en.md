# About Actions
![ActionsListSample](img/ActionsListSample.jpg)

Actions are a part of what constructs your gimmick.
By using Actions you can:

- Open browser pages
- Toggle On/Off objects and colliders
- Play animations and audios ...etc.

# Cautions
Keep in mind these points when setting up your Actions:

- Actions are executed in order from the top
- Changes made by Actions are only applied locally (the world on your device)
- Unity's Play function is not supported. To check if your Actions are working, use Build And Run
