As an option, you could move the SDK inside GALLAREAL into your own Unity Project.

VketCloudSDK is contained under Packages. Drag and drop the whole SDK folder into your Project's Packages folder. It would be functional even from the Assets folder, but it's not recommended.

Open the Unity Package Manager, and if VketCloudSDK is recognized as a local package, the migration is a success.
