# Setting Skybox
  
Unity's SkyBox settings cannot be directly exported with HEOExporter.
  
Instead, place and output a huge object (about 300m) in which the face of Box or Sphere is reversed.
In that case, select "Unlit/Texture" for the material.

â˜… If you download the tutorial scene (Basic) from the control panel (VketCloudSDK menu > Controll Panel)  
You can use the Skybox sample.  
Copy and use it in your own projects!
